# 🏙️ E-Municipal: Digital City Management System

**E-Municipal** is a robust web application built with the **Laravel Framework**, designed to bridge the gap between citizens and municipal authorities. Using **Dhaka City** as its primary use case, this platform creates a seamless digital channel for civic engagement and administrative management.

In an era of "Smart Cities," E-Municipal replaces outdated manual processes with a centralized, transparent digital dashboard, empowering citizens to take an active role in their community's maintenance.

### 🚀 Key Features

**For Citizens:**
* **📢 Issue Reporting:** Easily file complaints regarding civic issues (e.g., waste management, road repairs, street lighting) with location tracking.
* **📄 Service Requests:** Apply for municipal services directly through the portal without visiting physical offices.
* **📊 Status Tracking:** Real-time updates on the progress of filed complaints and applications.

**For Administration:**
* **🛡️ Admin Control Panel:** A comprehensive dashboard to view, sort, and manage incoming citizen requests.
* **✅ Workflow Management:** Update status of tasks (Pending, In Progress, Resolved) to ensure accountability.
* **📈 Data Oversight:** centralized database of citizen activities and service history.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Backend:** PHP, Laravel Framework
* **Frontend:** Blade Templates, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Database:** MySQL

---
*Note: While currently modeled for Dhaka, this architecture is modular and scalable for any municipal corporation.*
